            <!-- <img class="p-img" src="1122.jpg" alt=""> -->
            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <p>Meditation is a practice where a person uses a technique such as mindfulness,
                or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity to train attention
                and awareness to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.
            </p>
            <p>Meditation is not about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better person
                It's about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective. You're not
                trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. Your're
                learning to observe them without judgement.
                And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well.

            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <img class="p-img" src="02.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Medition is very necessary for leading a healthy and stress free life.
                It helps in every aspects of life be it in managing the personal life or work life.</p>
            <p>Consciousness is often likened to a stream, shifting and changing smoothly as it passes
                over the terrain. Meditation is one deliberate means of changing the course of this stream,
                and in turn, altering how you perceive and respond to the world around you.</p>
            <p>
                Research has shown that meditation can have both physiological and psychological effects. Some of the
                positive physiological effects include a lowered state of physical arousal, reduced respiration rate,
                decreased
                heart rate, changes in brain wave patterns, and lowered stress

            <h4>Meditation and emotional well-being</h4>

            <h2 class="h2">How to practice it?</h2>
            <small>August, 2021</small>
            <img class="p-img" src="01.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Practing meditation requires a lot of practice and consistency to get results.</p>
            <p>There are many steps of doing meditation and types too but the most ideal and basic
                one is listed below (best for beginer).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find place to sit that feels calm and quite to you.</li>
                <li>If you’re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can
                    kneel—all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.
                </li>
                <li>Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.</li>
                <li>Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to
                    noticing that your mind has wandered—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes simply return your
                    attention to the breath.</li>
                <li>Don’t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come
                    back.</li>
                <li>When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and
                    notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and
                    emotions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That’s it! That’s the practice. You go away, you come back, and you try to do it as kindly as possible.
            </p>
